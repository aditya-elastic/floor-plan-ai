# AI Floor Planning

## Overview
Multimodality: Traditional AI models handle a single input type, like text, generating a single output. In contrast, multimodal models process diverse inputs—text, images, videos, and audio—producing varied outputs. This has advanced the AI's ability further to understand and interact with the world.
Here is a lightweight web application we have built using Dall-e for the detailed room labeling for enhanced planning and design of the floor.
